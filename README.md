# Features

# Requirements


# Setup

For a secure install, type the following (recommended):

    gem cert --add <(curl -Ls http://www.my-website.com/gem-public.pem)
    gem install milestoner --trust-policy MediumSecurity

NOTE: A HighSecurity trust policy would be best but MediumSecurity enables signed gem verification while
allowing the installation of unsigned dependencies since they are beyond the scope of this gem.
